title: Week 5:Evaluating Open Source Projects, and a Visit From Bloomberg
---

## Ghidra
This week, we evaluated open source projects in groups. I specifically, was in a group that focused on the project [Ghidra](https://www.nsa.gov/resources/everyone/ghidra/) which is a software reverse engineering project developed by the NSA. Ghidra itself has all the signs of a good open source project to contribute to. It is very easy to find information on how to contribute, and they even have a full [developer's guide](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/master/DevGuide.md) to get people started. Yet even though the community provides all this support, this project is one that I would have great difficulty contributing to as it seems that very specialized knowledge is required, in the area of reverse engineering to understand most of the repository. 

This understanding part is probably the most difficult aspect of finding an open soruce project to contribute to, especially if the project is one that one has no experience in using. Even navigating all the files becomes difficult, as in the case of Ghidra.
I would assume this is the case for most open source projects actually, and therefore I have realized that it is essential to pick a project that aligns with one's interests as a lot of time would be spent analyzing the project, figuring out where things are and what things do.

Keeping this in mind, some other aspects of choosing open source projects such as their code of conduct may be less important than interest that the project has towards oneself. 
In the case of Ghidra, they didn't even have a code of conduct. Perhaps since the project was developed by the NSA, they are in a way asserting dominance by simply not doing so. Their name itself is the code of conduct.
